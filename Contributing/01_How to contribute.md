# How to contribute

This project is powered by you! You can contribute anything you feel is worth knowing or sharing.

## Method 1:

Go to [the GitHub](https://github.com/lukevanlukevan/h-python-wiki) and make a pull request.

Add your page under it's respective folder (or create a new one), and bundle your images in the folder if you need them.

If you want to be really fancy, you can help me out by adding FrontMatter to your markdown file, at the top of the .md file like this:

```markdown
---
title: "How to contribute"
author: [{ name: "Luke Van", link: "https://github.com/lukevanlukevan" }]
---
```

## Method 2:

Construct a folder with your .md file and the images if needed. As above, FrontMatter is greatly appreciated as it saves a lot of time.

Then, click through to the [upload page](/upload) and fill in the appropriate fields, upload your folder as an archive of your choice, and submit!
