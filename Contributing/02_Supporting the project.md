# Supporting the project

As with any free project, and support of any type is always appreciated. Be it a donation, a submission or even some kind words on the Discord server, everything is a huge help to me!

You can [buy me a coffee](https://bmc.link/lukevan), or you [contribute to the server](/Contributing#how-to-contribute) if you feel like you want to give something back.

If you got this far, thank you!
