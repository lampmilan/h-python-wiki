# Shelf Script Basics

From a very simple standpoint, a shelf script is a single use script that can be clicked on and bound to a hotkey.
You may be familiar with "shelf tools", which, under the hood, are a python script that places a bunch of nodes and sets their parameters to desired values.

To start off, lets make a script that will print to the console.

Create a new shelf tab, and then right click in the tab to create a "New tool."

Inside, we type:

```python
print('we created a new script')
```

From this, we get our message in the console. Very exciting!
