# Life Hacks

Pulling a [Paul Esteves](https://www.instagram.com/paulesteves28/) and calling this a hack. :P

Sadly certain files are not "package-able" and need to be edited in the Houdini prefs folder. One of those is `jump.pref`, which we can use in this instance to add our new package variable to this file.

```text
$LV
```

That's literally it, now when you open up the file explorer in Houdini, you can see the unexpanded variable on the sidebar.

This is a good timesave if you are often jumping around saving stuff. Certain menus (like saving the shelves) will benefit from this.
