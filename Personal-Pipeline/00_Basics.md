# Basics

Once you get further into messing with all of the menus and scripts, you may find just working in the shelf tool editor to be a bit cumbersome, as well as in some cases, it can even end up corrupting your shelf tool and losing a few or all scripts. I've opted for setting up a personal package that allows me to organize and control all of the things. It also allows you to share your package with others for personal purposes, or even if you are working as a team.

Here are all the things I would suggest setting up:

-   [Set up your external code editor](#external-code-editor)
-   [Create a personal package](#personal-package)
